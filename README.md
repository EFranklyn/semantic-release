# Welcome adventurous!

This project implements semantic release, a powerful tool for automating versioning and releases based on semantic versioning principles.

### What is semantic-release?
[Semantic Release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) is a tool that automates the versioning and release process based on the commit messages in your repository. It analyzes the commits made since the last release, determines the appropriate version bump (major, minor, or patch), generates release notes, and publishes the new version of your software automatically. This ensures consistency, eliminates human error in versioning, and facilitates smooth, predictable releases.

### CI & CD with GitHub Actions
In this project, we leverage the power of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) using GitHub Actions in conjunction with semantic-release. Here's how it works:

-   **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Every time a new commit is pushed to the repository, GitHub Actions automatically triggers a CI workflow. This workflow ensures that your code compiles successfully and passes any necessary checks before moving on to the release process.
    
-   **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Once the CI process is successful, semantic-release kicks in. It analyzes the commit messages, determines the appropriate version bump, generates release notes, and publishes the new version to the appropriate package registry or distribution channel. This ensures that your software is always up-to-date and ready for deployment.
